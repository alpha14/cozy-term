# What is Cozy?

[Cozy](http://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space.  With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you
with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one
profiles you. You install only the applications you want. You can build your
own one too.
